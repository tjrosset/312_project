Flask is a lightweight python web application framework that allows developers to focus on the web application istself by simplifying the backend. Using the flask framework will help our team in a variety of different ways. 
It will parse incoming request information for us as well as build response requests for us. This will make serving content to the user much easier.
Flask also allows us to serve static files with little work. This will help for images/css files.
Flask will handle HTTP exceptions for us as well. It will also make the implentation of authentication smoother and simpler with its use encoding of sessions.
We will store the user information on login in a session. This information will be used to send information between sockets and display who is online. 
The sessions will also make logout a breeze as we can just pop the user info from the session on logout.
Another thing that flask does for us is both handles and creates TCP connections.

Flask URL:

Flask will build the url path by using the information given by the user in the decorator. @app.route('/'). 
This decorator uses add_url_rule(). This binds a url to the function that will decide what occurs on that path. 
This method will also allow us to pick and choose what http method can be used on this path.

HTTP Requests:

LINK dispatching: https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/3c9b85469ef4abda1e996a5ec0e7bef0f1a0b394/src/flask/app.py#L1463

When flask recieves a request from the server it will store it into a global object to be used elsewhere.
The object that flask uses is from Werkzeug, but adds a couple more attributes of its own.
The attributes that are provided by flask and werkzeug allow for http requests to be easily parsed by the user.
Using finalize_request() flask will finish the http request by converting it into a response object, conduct postprocessing, and then send the response.


HTTP Responses:
Link Response object: https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/3c9b85469ef4abda1e996a5ec0e7bef0f1a0b394/src/flask/wrappers.py#L101

LINK Create response: https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/3c9b85469ef4abda1e996a5ec0e7bef0f1a0b394/src/flask/app.py#L1616\
LINK render_template: https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/3c9b85469ef4abda1e996a5ec0e7bef0f1a0b394/src/flask/templating.py#L130
Flask response objects are built off of the response objects from Werkzeug, but flask sets up responses to have the html mimetype by default (line 119 of object link)
Flask uses make_response to create the http response using the value returned by the user at the end of the function. This will allow us to add our own headers to the response if needed.
Using make_response is different then returning rernder_template.
Render_template() will render the provided file using the JinjaLoader library.
Using finalize_request() flask will finish the http request by converting it into a response object, conduct postprocessing, and then send the response.



AUTHENTICATION AND SESSIONS
https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/src/flask/sessions.py
Flask uses its own sessions to store data to be used between multiple server requests. Flasks sessions are created using signed cookies. 
The session object itself is stored as a dictionary object which will allow you to access your stored data using key value pairs. Sessions are only able to be used if the flask application has a secret key set. 
The session information cannot be changed if the secret key is not known this is because when Flask encodes this cookie with the secret string you provide it into a base64 encoding.
